# Tips for Using NBAPredict!

## Prediction

First, you'll want to input your own prediction for the NBA season! Simply head over to "Your Prediction"
and drag and drop the teams under the tables labeled "Your Prediction." Once you're satisfied with the
selected order, hit Submit! You'll see a Score value filled in; this will update dynamically throughout
the NBA season, and it reflects the accuracy of your prediction. Note that your account has exactly
one prediction associated with it!

## Leagues

At its core, NBAPredict is about predicting the NBA's season alongside your friends!
Forming leagues with friends is integral to the NBAPredict experience.

If you don't already have a league to join, you can create one by clicking "Create Leagues"
and entering a Name and a Password for your league. Then, users can join your league by
inputing the same Name and Password into the page found under "Join Leagues."

Once you've created and/or joined leagues, you can view the list of leagues you're in under
"View Leagues." For each league in the table of all your leagues, you can click that league's
name to view that league's leaderboard! This tells you how accurate the predictions are for
each user in the league.
